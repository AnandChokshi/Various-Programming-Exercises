Find Writer
<br />
You have a set of rows with names of famous writers encoded inside. Each row is divided into 2 parts by pipe char (|). The first part has a writer's name. The second part is a "key" to generate a name.

Your goal is to go through each number in the key (numbers are separated by space) left-to-right. Each number represents a position in the 1st part of a row. This way you collect a writer's name which you have to output.
