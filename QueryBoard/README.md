There is a board (matrix). Every cell of the board contains one integer, which is 0 initially. 

The next operations can be applied to the Query Board: 
SetRow i x: it means that all values in the cells on row "i" have been changed to value "x" after this operation. 
SetCol j x: it means that all values in the cells on column "j" have been changed to value "x" after this operation. 
QueryRow i: it means that you should output the sum of values on row "i". 
QueryCol j: it means that you should output the sum of values on column "j". 

The board's dimensions are 256x256 
"i" and "j" are integers from 0 to 255 
"x" is an integer from 0 to 31
