Split the number
<br />
You are given a number N and a pattern. The pattern consists of lowercase latin letters and one operation "+" or "-". The challenge is to split the number and evaluate it according to this pattern e.g. 
1232 ab+cd -> a:1, b:2, c:3, d:2 -> 12+32 -> 44
<br /><br />
input:<br />
Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line of the file is a test case, containing the number and the pattern separated by a single whitespace. <br />
For Example: <br />
3413289830 a-bcdefghij

output:<br />
For each test case print out the result of pattern evaluation.<br />
For Example:-413289827
